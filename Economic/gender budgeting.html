<h2>What is Gender Budgeting?</h2>
<p>Gender budgeting is a strategy that integrates a gender perspective into the budgetary process to assess how government spending impacts men and women differently [5]. It aims to promote gender equality by ensuring equitable distribution of public resources [5]. The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) defines it as a tool to achieve gender mainstreaming, ensuring that development benefits women as much as men [1].</p>

<h2>History and Evolution</h2>
<p>Gender Budgeting in India was introduced in 2005-06 [2][5]. In 2010, the Planning Commission recommended replacing the Women Component Plan with Gender Responsive Budgeting [4]. By 2021, 27 states and Union Territories had adopted Gender Budgeting [1][4].</p>

<h2>Key Components</h2>
<p>The Gender Budget Statement (GBS) comprises two parts [2]:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Part A:</b> Women Specific Schemes, with 100% allocation for women [2][5].</li>
  <li><b>Part B:</b> Pro Women Schemes, where at least 30% of the allocation is for women [2][5].</li>
  <li><b>Part C:</b> Schemes with less than 30% provisioning for women [4].</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gender Budget 2024-25</h2>
<p>The Gender Budget for 2024-25 reached 1% of GDP for the first time, with allocations surpassing â‚¹3 lakh crore [4][5][7]. This budget emphasizes women-led development [7].</p>

<h2>Challenges and Issues</h2>
<p>India's Gender Budget remains in the range of 4-6% of the total expenditure and less than 1% of its GDP [1]. A significant portion of gender budgeting is concentrated in five key ministries, with MGNREGA being the biggest scheme [1]. Areas like transportation and water security are often ignored [1].</p>

<h2>What Needs to Be Done</h2>
<p>To promote gender budgeting, there is a need to move towards gender-sensitive formulation of legislation, programmes and schemes; allocation of resources; implementation and execution; audit and impact assessment of programmes and schemes; and follow-up corrective action to address gender disparities [3].</p>
