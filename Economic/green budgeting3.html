<h1>Gender Budgeting in India</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Gender budgeting is a fiscal strategy that integrates gender perspectives into budgetary decisions to ensure equitable resource allocation for men and women. In India, it was formally introduced in 2005-06 to address gender disparities through policy interventions.</p>

<h2>Objectives of Gender Budgeting</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure gender equality in resource distribution</li>
    <li>Address socio-economic disparities in education, health, and employment</li>
    <li>Promote women’s participation in decision-making and workforce</li>
    <li>Make policies gender-responsive and inclusive</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evolution of Gender Budgeting in India</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Pre-2005 Era:</b> Policies focused on women's welfare but lacked structured gender budgeting.</li>
    <li><b>2005-06 Onward:</b> The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Women & Child Development institutionalized gender budgeting.</li>
    <li><b>Current Status:</b> Gender budgeting is implemented across multiple ministries and states, with specific allocations for women-centric programs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Mechanism of Gender Budgeting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Gender Budgeting Cells (GBCs):</b> Established in ministries/departments.</li>
    <li><b>Categorization of Expenditure:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Part A:</b> 100% allocation for women (e.g., Maternity Benefit Scheme)</li>
            <li><b>Part B:</b> At least 30% allocation benefits women</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Annual Gender Budget Statement:</b> Included in Union Budget since 2005-06.</li>
</ul>
